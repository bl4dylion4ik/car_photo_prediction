#### Data Preparation
I used dataset which i made by myself, using site av.by for extract and load image. You can also download [entire dataset](https://github.com/bl4dylion4ik/car_photo_prediction). Dataset contain about 400.000 not processed img.
Also, if you want to download [processed dataset](https://github.com/bl4dylion4ik/car_photo_prediction), with most popular brand, you can download it too.
Original dataset contain folder with brand and modelname, like ../Audi/A4/{1-500}.jpg. Three sample images are shown below:


While checking through the data, i observed that the dataset contained many unwanted images, e.g., pictures of wing mirrors, door handles, GPS panels, or lights, so i process dataset manually.
Examples of unwanted images can be seen below.
